  Pings a Healthchecks.io check to signal job start or completion.
  Use as a pre-job hook to signal "start" and a post-job hook to signal success/failure.
  Healthchecks.io will alert you if your scheduled transfers stop running — a dead-man's switch
  for critical file transfer jobs. Free tier available at healthchecks.io.
