It handles everything: checking prerequisites, installing Node.js if needed, downloading the latest release, creating OS-standard directories, generating a secure AUTH_SECRET, and registering FileBridge as a system service that starts automatically on boot.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"Structured-Logging":{"id":"Structured-Logging","title":"Structured Logging","description":"FileBridge emits structured JSON logs using pino, a high-performance Node.js logger. All log output goes to stdout as newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON), making it natively compatible with modern log aggregation platforms.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"Transfer-Engine":{"id":"Transfer-Engine","title":"Transfer Engine","description":"The transfer engine (lib/transfer/engine.ts) is the core of FileBridge.
