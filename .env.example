# Database
# Path to the SQLite database file
# In production (Docker), this should point to the mounted volume: /app/data/filebridge.db
DATABASE_PATH=./data/filebridge.db

# Node.js / OpenSSL compatibility
# Required when using SMB connections on Node.js 17+ (OpenSSL 3).
# v9u-smb2 uses NTLM which requires the MD4 algorithm removed from OpenSSL 3's default provider.
# The npm dev/start scripts already set this automatically.
# In Docker or other environments, set it in the container's environment:
#   NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

# Dev Auth Bypass (DEVELOPMENT ONLY — NEVER set to true in production)
# When both are "true", all auth checks are skipped and a "Dev User" session is injected.
# AUTH_BYPASS_DEV is read server-side (middleware, API routes).
# NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_BYPASS_DEV is read client-side (AuthGuard, AuthButton).
AUTH_BYPASS_DEV=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_BYPASS_DEV=false

# SSO providers (Azure AD, GitHub, etc.) are configured via the admin UI
# after completing the initial setup wizard. No environment variables needed.
